# ChromaLock
This is the Fall 2023 CS1600 Final Project.

## Overview
Chromalock is a colorful keypad lock that allows users to securely and easily store their precious physical possessions.
Users would be able to set a digital numeric lock code that
they can enter using a keypad. If the correct code is entered,
the system will unlock, show a colorful LED display, make
fun sounds and rotate a servo motor to simulate the opening
of a lock. If an incorrect code is entered, we will signify that
with a flash of red LEDs. When the system is unlocked, users
will be able to lock it again using the combination they set
earlier. Locking will move the motor in the opposite direction.
Users will also have the option to change the combination
when the system is unlocked.
